# Getting started

To build a manifest

```
npm run start '{"keese": null, "react": null}'
```

The last line of output should be manifest you can feed to [systemjs](public/sandbox/boot/m.json)

Open up [index.html](public/sandbox/index.html) and checkout [index.js](public/sandbox/index.html) to see how I feed this to systemjs

Tested with SystemJS v0.20.9.

Stable in my testing but use it at your own risk.
